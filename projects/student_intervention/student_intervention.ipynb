Like most Machine Learning algorithm, the algorithm works in two stages: training and testing. I will describe each of these stages separately to give you a better idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "*** Training *** \n",
    "we use for training, the data for students for whom we already know the result. Given sufficient data of both sides (passing and not-passing), the algorithm lands upon a boundary that minimizes the error of misclassification. That means that most of the passing students will be on one side of this boundary, and most of the failing students will be on the other side.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine data on a plane, and having only two features (along each of the axes). If we've chosen our features wisely and the data can be separated with a line, the SVM algorithm will find a line that separates the data into two regions. In the figure below ([ref](https://www.mql5.com/en/articles/584)), you can see the SVM algorithm converging step by step on the boundary. \n",

    "What is interesting in the above is that the data is **not** linearly separable. How then, you might ask, did the SVM come up with this separator? What we can do with SVM is that we can introduce an extra dimension. In this case, that would mean adding a value corresponding to each of the points on the plane. So in this third dimension, each point can corresponds to a point sticking out of the page at different heights. What we can do is choose a mapping of \"point\" to \"height\" so that we can be sure that the data can in fact be separated when this extra dimension is introduced. Isn't that cool? This is what is called, in MLspeak, the Kernel Trick. And the mapping is called a Kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm now goes further and says that the only points that are of interest are the support vectors, which are the points on both sides closest to the boundary. They, in effect, support this boundary. The advantage of these points is that, in classifying a new point, the algorithm only needs to consider the values at these support vectors, rather than the whole set of training data. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many parameters that can be tuned for SVMs, including the kernel type, the learning parameter (which affects how much the line moves in each step), and so on, which makes SVMs extremely hackable and good to play with, for various problems.\n",
